# My To Do List

* Write code for the blob store for storing file content
* Implement basic meta data and file store for debian archives
* Write code to populate the metadata store
* Write code to scan for packages and load them into the metadata store

* Look into doing package generation (for export option of subutai)
* Look into doing package generation for plugins developed at subutai
* Have these automatically deployed to a developers own personal repo
  that is hosted on the hub and offered to the market place etc.

* Start looking into repository structure and dynamically updating
  functionality.
* We need a REST API for this
* Might be nice to make a plugin later do do some things?

* Setup project resources including sonar, jira
